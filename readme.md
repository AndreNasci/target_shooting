# Target Shooting

The aim of this project is to build a practical example of a distributed system 
and also learn and put into practice some useful tools, like Git, 
Docker and Nodejs.

The same screen is displayed for two players. By clicking on one of the red circles, the game status is updated for both clients, as well as the players' scores.
